🏝️ Treasure Island Adventure Game

Treasure Island is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python. The player makes choices at different stages of the game, and each decision leads to either finding the treasure or a game over.

🎯 Objective

Your mission is to find the hidden treasure by making the correct choices along the way. Choose wisely—one wrong move and the game ends!
